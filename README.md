# LastWhisper-Discord-Bot
The is the code for the discord bot of the The Last Whisper Free Company in the game Final Fantasy XIV.

Features of the Discord bot:
  - The ability to set a buff rotation for a user defined number of weeks and how the bot post the buff on a specified channel.
  - The ability to change members roles based on reactions.
  - The ability to post a custom message to a channel on a set time.
  - The ability for the bot to record FFXIV guild or Discord server events and post reminders to events (still experimental).
  - Some management tools such as clear channel of messages.
  - The ability to create cogs and extensions and have the bot load, unload and reload them (Bot admin specific).
  
Features the Discord bot does not have:
  - Log spefic server information except for config information.
  - Music bot (Yes it is there but I am not gonna finish it due to complexity)
  - Web based dash board (I do plan on creating one in the future but have no idea where to start. Any information would be appriciated.)
  - Console dash board (Still working on plans.)
  
Prerequisite:
  - Python 3.8 and above (I am using the ":=" operation which requires a modern version)
  - discord.py 1.5 or above (I use Intents in the code.)
